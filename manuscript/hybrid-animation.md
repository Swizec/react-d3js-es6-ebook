It's a donut chart that transitions to a bar chart. Same component, same React
code, different radius. 29,905px instead of 728px. ü§Ø

I _actually_ got the idea from that flat earth documentary on Netflix. Behind
the Curve. No joke.

Why do flat earth people believe the earth is flat?

It's because the curve is soooooooo big that it looks flat.

That gave me an idea for a client project. They asked me to build a smooth
transition from a donut-shaped visualization to a bar chart shape.

No idea how to do that so I stalled for weeks by building everything else
first. Until one day I had an idea

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I just discovered a new approach to React + D3 transitions ü§Ø Of course this happens juuuust when I think React for Data Visualization is complete<br><br>Check this out, it combines the &quot;game loop via state changes&quot; with the &quot;D3 runs transitions&quot; approach <a href="https://t.co/mMglR4hDwp">pic.twitter.com/mMglR4hDwp</a></p>&mdash; Swizec Teller (@Swizec) <a href="https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/1102818340991430656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2019</a></blockquote>

You can _combine the two approaches to animation_ you learned in React for Data
Visualization. We talked about

1. **The game loop approach.** Borrows ideas from the gaming industry. Call
   `this.setState` 60 times per second and your React component animates.
   Wonderful.

2. **The D3 transition approach.** You take a React component, use props as a
   staging area, render from state, and use `componentDidMount` or `useEffect`
   to hand over rendering control to D3. D3 runs its transition, manipulates
   the DOM, then gives control back to React.

## A new approach to complex transitions

Now there's a 3rd approach. Something I never thought of before and it works
great.

Let's look at the transition again

![](https://i.imgur.com/hzKOMXi.gif)

Here's what happens behind the scenes to make it work:

1. A `<Donut>` component renders a bunch of `<Arc>`s
2. Each `<Arc>` takes care of its complex shape. Built from 3 different D3 arc
   generators
3. The whole thing is driven by D3's pie generator. It calculates start and end
   angles for individual arcs
4. Donut size is a function of radius. The bigger the radius, the bigger the
   donut.
5. As the radius increases from 728 to 29,905 the donut grows
6. And it moves down as fast as it grows. Without moving, it would fly off the
   screen and you'd never see it again
7. To keep the pie exactly 728px wide even though it's rendered on a 29,905px
   donut ... well you gotta calculate
   [the arc segment](https://planetcalc.com/1421/) and derive start and end
   angles from that

ü§Ø

That's a lot of stuff.

And it's all driven by this code. The transition üëá

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D03-2wtU8AASbl-.jpg)

I call this on component mount. Could be on a click event or whatever. Starts a
custom tween transition with D3.

That lets D3 control the timing, the easing functions, keeping it smooth, all
of that. You don't have to think about any of it.

But instead of changing a DOM attribute, my tween calls `this.setState` on the
React component. Meaning it's _changing React state_ instead.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/26ufdipQqU2lhNA4g/giphy.gif)

Since the donut bar chart knows how to render itself based on a radius ... well
... you can keep re-rendering at various radiuses and It Just Works.

Smooth transition by re-rendering the whole visualization 60 times per second.
Even though it's a super complex component. Lots of moving parts and
subcomponents.

Knowing everything that's going on behind the scenes I am _blown away_ by how
well it works.

React is magic.

![A smoothly transitioning piechart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/transition-pie.gif)

Transitions like we used above work using interpolators. For numbers, an
interpolator is easy: A function that parametrizes changes to a single
argument.

```javascript
let i = d3.interpolateNumber(10, 20);
i(0.0); // 10
i(0.2); // 12
i(0.5); // 15
i(1.0); // 20
```

D3 can interpolate everything from numbers, to colors, and even objects or
strings. It does so by finding interpolatable parts of your argument and
manipulating them linearly depending on the `t` parameter.

But sometimes you need custom interpolators ‚Äì tweens.

Say you want to animate an arc shape. The path definition argument is a complex
string üëá

```

```

If that doesn't make sense, don't worry. I can't read it either.

When you transition a shape like that, funny things can happen. Sometimes arcs
fly around the screen, sometimes you get an error.

![Naively implemented transition. Notice the arcs change shape sometimes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/naive-transition-d3-pie.gif)

Notice the arc wobble.

## Tweens to the rescue

Luckily, D3 lets us define custom transitions called tweens. To smoothly
animate a piechart we can build an `arcTween`. Because piecharts are made of
arcs.

The idea is to move from transitioning path definitions, to transitioning
angles on a pie slice. We build a tween generator that takes some params and
returns a tweening function.

Tweening functions lie behind all transitions. They take an argument, `t`, and
return the value of your prop at a specific "time" of your transition. All
transitions you've used so far are built with tweens in the background.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/2018-version/manuscript/resources/images/2018/transition-sketch.png)

Our tween generator is going to need:

1.  `oldData`, the definition of our pie slice at the start of the transition
2.  `newData`, the definition of our pie slice that we want to tween towards
3.  `arc`, a
    [D3 arc generator](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#arcs)

Both `oldData` and `newData` come from a
[D3 pie generator](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/master/README.md#pies).
The `startAngle` and `endAngle` is what we're interested in.

Our `arcTween` function uses these to build a tween method that we then feed
into `attrTween`.

```javascript
// inspired from http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5100636
function arcTween(oldData, newData, arc) {
  const copy = { ...oldData };
  return function() {
    const interpolateStartAngle = d3.interpolate(
        oldData.startAngle,
        newData.startAngle
      ),
      interpolateEndAngle = d3.interpolate(oldData.endAngle, newData.endAngle);

    return function(t) {
      copy.startAngle = interpolateStartAngle(t);
      copy.endAngle = interpolateEndAngle(t);
      return arc(copy);
    };
  };
}
```

We make a `copy` of `oldData` so we don't change input data by accident, then
we return a function. This function creates two interpolators with
`d3.interpolate`. One for each angle.

Each interpolator starts from an `oldData` angle and moves towards a `newData`
angle.

This function then returns our interpolation function. It takes the argument
`t`, feeds it into our two interpolators, adjusts values on the `copy` object,
feeds that into the `arc` generator, and returns a new path definition.

You use it like this üëá

```javascript
// Arc.js
d3.select(this.refs.elem)
  .transition()
  .duration(80)
  .attrTween('d', arcTween(this.state.d, newProps.d, this.arc))
  .on('end', () =>
    this.setState({
      d: newProps.d,
      pathD: this.arc(newProps.d),
    })
  );
```

Select an element, a `<path>`, start a transition, make it last `80`
milliseconds, `attrTween` the path definition, `d`, attribute using the tween
returned from `arcTween`.

## A practical example

Here's an example of how you might use that in an animated piechart. Same idea
works for any custom transition you want to build.

https://codesandbox.io/s/px7x26020/

<!--- begin-lecture title="Use tweens to drive state" -->

You now have all the ingredients for hybrid animation:

1. Custom tweens for tight transition control
2. State changes to drive animation

Let's bring them together ‚úåÔ∏è

https://codesandbox.io/s/optimistic-architecture-oluvf

Red squares in a circle. Click one, they all fly out ‚Äì bouncing like they're
tied to an elastic. Click again and the circle contracts.

Silly example, sure, but a useful technique. Same way the piechart to bar chart
transition worked.

It all happens in the `<HybridExample />` component.

```javascript
<HybridExample width={500} height={500} x={250} y={250} />
```

## <HybridExample />

Hybrid example is a functional component based on React Hooks. We use state for
the `radius`, an `angleScale` to position rectangles, and an `explode` function
to trigger the transition.

```javascript
const HybridExample = ({ x, y }) => {
  const [radius, setRadius] = useState(10);
  const N = 10;

  const angleScale = d3
    .scaleLinear()
    .domain([0, N])
    .range([0, Math.PI * 2]);

  const explode = () => {
    // transition
  };

  return (
    <g transform={`translate(${x}, ${y})`} onClick={explode}>
      {d3.range(N).map(i => (
        <Square
          x={Math.cos(angleScale(i)) * radius}
          y={Math.sin(angleScale(i)) * radius}
          key={i}
        />
      ))}
    </g>
  );
```

`useState` hook gives us initial `radius` of 10 and a `setRadius` function to
change it. `angleScale` translates linearly between a domain of 0 to N, and
angles in radians. 0 is 0, 2PI is a full circle.

We render squares the usual way:

- grouping element for positioning
- loop over a range of size `N`
- `<Square />` for each iteration
- use trigonometry to translate angles to `x` and `y` coordinates

Here's a helpful image, if you've forgotten your high school maths like I have

![sin for vertical, cos for horizontal](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Sinus_und_Kosinus_am_Einheitskreis_1.svg/1920px-Sinus_und_Kosinus_am_Einheitskreis_1.svg.png)

## Tween-driven state changes for animation

We used `onClick={explode}` to trigger the animation. Here's what that looks
like

```javascript
const explode = () => {
  const elastic = d3.easeElasticOut;
  elastic.amplitude(5);
  elastic.period(-0.3);

  d3.selection()
    .transition('radius-boom')
    .ease(elastic)
    .duration(1000)
    .tween('radius', () => {
      const radiusInt = d3.interpolate(radius, radius > 10 ? 10 : 60);
      return t => setRadius(radiusInt(t));
    });
};
```

`explode` starts by creating a new easing function ‚Äì¬†`elastic`. Elastic easing
is built into D3 and you can tweak its `amplitude` and `period`. Try different
values to see what happens.

We start a new virtual `d3.selection()`. Doesn't select anything, lets us run a
transition. Gotta give it a name though ‚Äì¬†`radius-boom`.

Then we specify the easing function, the duration, and create a custom tween.

```javascript
.tween("radius", () => {
	const radiusInt = d3.interpolate(radius, radius > 10 ? 10 : 60);
	return t => setRadius(radiusInt(t));
});
```

Our tween operates on the `radius`, which isn't even an SVG property. That's
just a logical name we use.

The tween itself uses an interpolator that goes from current radius ‚Äì¬†that's
the state ‚Äì¬†to either `10` or `60`. Small or large. That way we can use the
same tween both for growing and shrinking the circle.

We return a parametrized function that takes a `t` parameter and calls
`setRadius` with a value from our interpolator.

`setRadius` is the set state function we defined earlier with `useState`, which
means we update state on every tick of the transition animation. Update state,
component re-renders, you get smooth animation.

Works great ‚úåÔ∏è
