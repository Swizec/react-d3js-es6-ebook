# Foreword

I wrote the first version of React+D3 in Spring 2015 as a dare.  Can I learn a thing and write a book in a month? Yes.

That first version was 91 pages long and sold a few hundred copies. Great success! 

You are reading, and watching, the pinnacle of how this material has evolved over almost 4 years. 4 years I've been working on this. Not every day, not all the time. 

Little experiments here and there, launches and relaunches about once a year. Learning how to do video, exploring new approaches, hosting in-person workshops.

A lot has changed. 

React isn't what it used to be. The internals are different, the API is easier to use. Hooks just flipped everything on its head all over again. Suspense and async rendering are here and getting even better.

D3 has seen less change, but still went through major improvements. It's easier to use now. Easier to understand. More modern.

It feels like the web development world is a different place in late 2018 than it was in early 2015. It really does. Look at my code from 3 years ago and I think *"What!? We used to live like this? This is horrible"*

Almost 200 people bought this version of React+D3 in preorders alone. It started as a book update and grew into a proper online course.

If you're one of those early supporters, thank you! You are the best. Without you this never would have happened. 🙏

Because I think it's interesting, here's what I had to say about that first version back in 2015:

> I wrote this book for you as an experiment. The theory we’re testing is that technical content works better as a short e-book than as a long article.

> You see, the issue with online articles is that they live and die by their length. As soon as you surpass 700 words, everything falls apart. Readers wander off to a different tab in search of memes and funny tweets, never to come back.

> This hurts my precious writer's ego, but more importantly, it sucks for you. If you're not reading, you're not learning.

> So here we both are.

> I’m counting on you to take some time away from the internet, to sit down and read. I'm counting on you to follow the examples. I'm counting on you to *learn*.

> You’re counting on me to have invested more time, effort, and care in crafting this than I would have invested in an article. I have.

> I’ve tried to keep this book as concise as possible. iA Writer estimates it will take you about an hour to read *React+d3.js*, but playing with the examples might take some time, too.


A lot of that still rings true. People are distracted, busy, the internet is shiny. It's hard to sit down and learn stuff.

The most common feedback I get from students goes something like this 👇

> Loving your book! It's amazing. So clear and concise and relatable. But I read 20 pages, then my wife had a kid, my boss pulled the project, and I'm doing backend now. But truly amazing. I'm gonna get back to it as soon as I can!

Sometimes they do.

That's okay. Life happens. I understand. Hell, I procrastinated for months before sitting down to update this stuff :)

I recommend you go through the basic chapters at least. The little building blocks. You can do that in an afternoon or two. It's worth it, I promise.
